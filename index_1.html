                            <h2>Why Squat?</h2>
                            <p>Squatting is a very good exercise that works every muscle group in the body. When surveyed, most women mentioned that they wish to have a <em>more toned body</em> and a <em>firmer bum</em>, while most men want to gain muscles. Squats are the perfect exercise for both purposes, as squats are a whole-body exercise.
                            </p>

                            <h2>How To Squat</h2>
                            <p>
                                There are many good tutorials on how to squat, and they are all much better tutorials than what we can write here. Our favourites are <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs_Ej32IYgo" target="_blank">Alan Thrall's How To Squat</a> (if you do barbell squats), or if you're more into bodyweight squatting, Dave Mace's tutorial is quite good.

                                It should be noted that we each have different physiologies and there is no one universal "perfect" squat form. Some people squat with their toes pointed outwards, while some people squat with their toes pointed straight ahead. Despite this, there are some things almost everyone can agree on that is bad form:
                            </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Knees that cave inwards</li>
                                    <li>Wobbling knees</li>
                                    <li>Rounding of the upper back</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>
                                <strong>SquatCoach</strong> was built around this philosophy, as well as another: a good squat form will always be of good squat depth.
                            </p>

                            <h2>On Squat Depth</h2>
                            <p>A good squat form is very important in preventing injuries. In particular however, squat depth is often misunderstood, and wrong information is constantly shared. Contrary to conventional wisdom, a good squat depth is essential in preventing injuries. </p>

                            <p>In fact, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23821469" target="_blank">Hartman et al (2013)</a> concluded that <em>"...the deep squat presents an effective training exercise for protection against injuries and strengthening of the lower extremity. Contrary to commonly voiced concern, deep squats do not contribute increased risk of injury to passive tissues."</em></p>

                            <h2>What is A Good Squat Depth?</h2>
                            <p>A good squat depth is defined as when the hip crease is below the top of the knee-cap. The following image shows what that means:</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/squatdepth.jpg" alt="Good squat depth">
                            <p>Note that the hip crease, <span style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:bolder;">X</span> is actually lower than the knee-line <span style="color:#ff0000;font-weight:bolder;">A</span>.</p>

                            <p>The reason why proper squat depth is important is because if you don't hit this depth, you're actually putting a lot of weight on your quadriceps and your knees. Combined with the ascending motion of the latter part of the squat, the knee joints function to stop the momentum. This puts a lot of force on the knees, and could potentially lead to trauma.</p>

                            <p>Over the longer term, improper squat depth strengthens the quadriceps and ignores the posterior chain (the glutes and hamstrings in particular). This leads to muscular imbalances that will cause uneven tension on the kneecap, finally leading to pain of the knee, as well as frequent knee-related injuries.</p>

                            <p>Squatting at a good depth will train all the muscles evenly, leading to healthier kneecaps.</p>

                            <p><strong>SquatCoach</strong> (Android | iOS) was built to detect a good squat depth and good form. We used machine learning technologies to teach your phone what a good squat form looks like, and in turn, your phone can tell you if your form was good, and how to improve upon it.</p>

I thought it was deep enough, most of the time but I was wrong. Then I got injured. I tried various things to learn how to squat deeper. SquatCoach took guesswork out for me. Now I have the awareness to tell me how low I am squatting. The feedback works!<br><div style="text-align:right;">- Chewxy, Android User</div></li>

                                <strong>Who is this app for?</strong> <br>
                                We believe that to perform a good squat, a good kinesthetic awareness must first be developed. This app is geared towards people who are learning that kinesthetic awareness - to know how deep is a good depth. So who is this app for? Well, anyone who squats. We surprised a number of long-time squatters when we took this app out for trial runs - many people aren't actually aware that they don't squat with good form.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Must I strap the phone to my thighs?</strong><br>
                                Not really. When we first started testing this app, we found that a great many of our testers hacked around by putting their phones in their pockets. The phone still correctly vibrates when a good squat depth is achieved. However, we have found that the squat counts will no longer be accurate once you put the phone in the pocket. This is an area where we're actively working on to improve the experience.

                                <strong>How do I strap the phone to my thigh?</strong><br>
                                We discovered to our surprise, that simple armbands for phones like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SXRXUFE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00SXRXUFE&linkCode=as2&tag=squatcoach-20&linkId=RWC7LPNZBSCJA4EC">this one</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=squatcoach-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00SXRXUFE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> do actually fit most thighs. Of course some men and women have fairly developed thighs, and a simple arm band won't fit. We're brainstorming a solution for this at the moment. If you do have a hack, please do share it with us!

                                <strong>Why is this app so sparse in features?</strong><br>
                                We're big believers in doing one thing and do one thing well. As we iterated through the design of the SquatCoach app, we took out as much as possible to ensure that this app does one thing and does one thing well - teach the user how to squat with better form. There are definitely features we can see benefit in adding, such as tracking of one's squat history and social media sharing, and will be coming in future iterations of the app.
